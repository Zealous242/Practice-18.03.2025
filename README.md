# Create a widget that allows the user to determine the factorial of a number

# Create a function that determines the factors of a number and returns them in an array

# Create a widget that lists the factors of a number

# Create a function that returns the HCF of two numbers

# Create a function that lists prime numbers between two given numbers in an array

# Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz":

* If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz".
* If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz".
* If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.
* The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5.

Examples: 
fizz_buzz(3) ➞ "Fizz"

fizz_buzz(5) ➞ "Buzz"

fizz_buzz(15) ➞ "FizzBuzz"

fizz_buzz(4) ➞ "4"
